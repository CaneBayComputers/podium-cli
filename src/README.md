## üîß Essential Development Tools

### The `podium` Command

Podium provides a **single, unified command** that handles all development tasks. No more remembering dozens of aliases or complex Docker commands - just use `podium` followed by what you want to do.

### Why Containerized Tools Matter

Podium uses **containerized development tools** that run inside Docker containers instead of on your host system. This is **crucial for professional PHP development** because:

#### **üéØ Consistent Environment**
- **Same PHP version** across all team members
- **Identical extensions** and configurations  
- **No "works on my machine" problems**
- **Perfect for team collaboration**

#### **üîÑ Proper Dependencies**
- **Composer runs with correct PHP version** - ensures packages install correctly
- **WP-CLI uses container's WordPress environment** - commands work reliably  
- **Artisan uses container's Laravel setup** - migrations and commands execute properly
- **No host system conflicts** - your system PHP doesn't interfere

#### **üöÄ Professional Workflow Benefits**
- **Switch between PHP versions** per project without system changes
- **Clean host system** - no PHP version conflicts or extension issues
- **Portable environments** - same setup works on any developer's machine
- **Production parity** - development matches server environment

### Core Development Commands
```bash
# Composer (runs inside container with correct PHP environment)
podium composer install
podium composer require laravel/sanctum
podium composer update

# Laravel Artisan (runs inside container)
podium art migrate
podium art make:controller UserController
podium art tinker
podium art queue:work

# WordPress CLI (runs inside container)  
podium wp plugin list
podium wp user create john john@example.com --role=administrator
podium wp db export backup.sql

# PHP (runs inside container)
podium php -v
podium php script.php
```

### Enhanced Laravel Workflows
```bash
# Database refresh with seeding
podium db-refresh

# Clear all Laravel caches
podium cache-refresh
```

### Service Management
```bash
# Redis CLI access
podium redis KEYS "*"
podium redis-flush

# Direct container access
podium exec bash
podium exec-root bash
```

### System Management
```bash
# Manage shared services
podium start-services
podium stop-services

# Configure projects directory
podium config projects /path/to/projects
```

### Get Help Anytime
```bash
# See all available commands
podium help
```

## üåê Multi-Project Development

Podium excels at **managing multiple projects simultaneously across different frameworks**:

```bash
# Create multiple projects of different types
podium new                    # Interactive project creation
# Choose: WordPress, Laravel, or Basic PHP for each

# All running simultaneously:
# http://client-website     (WordPress)
# http://api-backend        (Laravel)  
# http://legacy-app         (PHP)
```

**Shared services** (MySQL, Redis, phpMyAdmin) serve all projects efficiently while maintaining complete isolation between projects.
