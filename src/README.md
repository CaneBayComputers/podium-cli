podium new my-awesome-app
```
**What happens:**
- Interactive framework selection (Laravel/WordPress/PHP)
- Automatic database setup and connection
- Environment files configured
- Project starts automatically
- **Ready to code immediately!**

### 2. Start Coding!
```bash
# Your project is ready at:
http://my-awesome-app
```

### 3. Daily Workflow
```bash
# Morning: Start everything
podium up

# Work on your projects...
# All projects accessible at http://project-name

# Evening: Clean shutdown (optional)
podium down
```

**That's it!** You now have a professional development environment with zero manual configuration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Commands

### Project Management

#### Creating New Projects
```bash
podium new [project_name]
```

Creates a new Laravel or WordPress project with:
- Interactive framework selection (Laravel/WordPress/PHP)
- Automatic database setup and connection
- Complete environment configuration
- Project starts automatically

**Examples:**
```bash
# Interactive creation
podium new

# Create with specific name
podium new my-awesome-app
```

#### Cloning Existing Projects
```bash
podium clone <repository> [project_name] [options]
```

Clones a Git repository and automatically sets it up as a Podium project:

**Examples:**
```bash
# Basic clone
podium clone https://github.com/user/my-laravel-app

# Clone with custom name
podium clone https://github.com/user/project my-local-name

# Clone with specific options
podium clone https://github.com/user/project --php-version 8 --overwrite-docker-compose
```

**Options:**
- `--overwrite-docker-compose`: Force overwrite existing Docker configs
- `--php-version VERSION`: Force PHP version (7 or 8)
- `--database ENGINE`: Database type (mysql, postgres, mongo)
- `--display-name NAME`: Custom display name
- `--description TEXT`: Project description
- `--emoji EMOJI`: Project emoji

#### Setting Up Downloaded/Copied Projects
```bash
podium setup <project_name> [options]
```

Configures manually downloaded or copied projects for Podium:

**Use Cases:**
```bash
# Manual Git clone
git clone https://github.com/user/project
podium setup project

# Downloaded ZIP file
# Extract to ~/podium-projects/project/
podium setup project

# Copied project folder
cp -r existing-project ~/podium-projects/new-project
podium setup new-project
```

**Smart Detection:**
- Automatically detects Laravel/WordPress/PHP projects
- Handles existing Docker configurations intelligently
- Prompts before overwriting non-Podium Docker files
- Configures databases, environments, and networking

#### Removing Projects Safely
```bash
podium remove <project_name>
```
- **`<project_name>`**: The name of the project to remove (required)

Safely removes a project by:
- Moving project directory to system trash (recoverable)
- Stopping and removing Docker containers
- Cleaning up database (with confirmation)
- Removing hosts file entries
- Cleaning up all project-related configurations

## ü™Ñ The Magic Commands - Daily Workflow

Podium is designed around two magic commands that handle your entire development environment:

### ‚ö° Morning Startup: `podium up`
```bash
podium up
```
**This single command does everything:**
- Starts all shared services (MariaDB, Redis, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- Starts ALL your project containers automatically
- Configures networking so all projects are accessible
- Shows status of everything that's running
- Makes all your projects available at `http://project-name`

**Perfect morning routine**: Open terminal, type `podium up`, grab coffee while everything starts! ‚òï

### üåÖ Evening Shutdown: `podium down`
```bash
podium down
```
**This single command cleans up everything:**
- Stops ALL running project containers
- Stops all shared services (databases, caches, etc.)
- Cleans up networking configurations
- Frees up system resources
- Preserves all your data and configurations

**Perfect evening routine**: Finish work, type `podium down`, everything shuts down cleanly! üåô

### ü§î Do I Need to Shut Down?

**Short answer: No, but it's nice to!**

- **Shutdown computer without `podium down`**: Docker automatically stops containers and will restart them when you boot up
- **Use `podium down` anyway because**:
  - Frees up RAM and CPU resources immediately
  - Clean shutdown prevents any potential data corruption
  - Good habit for development discipline
  - Useful when switching between different project sets

### üí° Daily Workflow Examples

```bash
# Monday morning - start everything for the week
podium up

# Tuesday through Thursday - everything keeps running
# (no commands needed, just work on your projects)

# Friday evening - clean shutdown for the weekend  
podium down

# Or just shut down your computer - Docker handles it! üíª
```

### Service Management

#### Redis Commands (Run from anywhere)
```bash
podium redis KEYS "*"          # Run Redis CLI commands
podium redis-flush             # Flush all Redis data
```

#### Memcached Commands (Run from anywhere)
```bash
podium memcache stats          # Show Memcached statistics
podium memcache-flush          # Flush all Memcached data
podium memcache-stats          # Detailed Memcached stats
```

#### Database Commands (Run from anywhere)
```bash
podium db-refresh              # Fresh migration + seed (Laravel)
podium cache-refresh           # Clear all Laravel caches
```

#### Supervisor Commands (Run from project directory)
```bash
# Must be run from within a project directory
cd ~/podium-projects/my-project
podium supervisor status       # Show all supervised processes
podium supervisor restart all  # Restart all processes
```

#### System Status
```bash
podium status                  # Check all projects and services
podium status <project_name>   # Check specific project
```

## üîß Essential Development Tools

### The `podium` Command

Podium provides a **single, unified command** that handles all development tasks. No more remembering dozens of aliases or complex Docker commands - just use `podium` followed by what you want to do.

### Why Containerized Tools Matter

Podium uses **containerized development tools** that run inside Docker containers instead of on your host system. This is **crucial for professional PHP development** because:

#### **üéØ Consistent Environment**
- **Same PHP version** across all team members
- **Identical extensions** and configurations  
- **No "works on my machine" problems**
- **Perfect for team collaboration**

#### **üîÑ Proper Dependencies**
- **Composer runs with correct PHP version** - ensures packages install correctly
- **WP-CLI uses container's WordPress environment** - commands work reliably  
- **Artisan uses container's Laravel setup** - migrations and commands execute properly
- **No host system conflicts** - your system PHP doesn't interfere

#### **üöÄ Professional Workflow Benefits**
- **Switch between PHP versions** per project without system changes
- **Clean host system** - no PHP version conflicts or extension issues
- **Portable environments** - same setup works on any developer's machine
- **Production parity** - development matches server environment

### Containerized Development Commands

**All these commands run inside your project's container with the correct PHP environment:**

#### Composer (Run from project directory)
```bash
cd ~/podium-projects/my-project
podium composer install
podium composer require laravel/sanctum
podium composer update
```

#### Laravel Artisan (Run from project directory)
```bash
cd ~/podium-projects/my-project
podium art migrate
podium art make:controller UserController
podium art tinker
podium art queue:work
```

#### WordPress CLI (Run from project directory)
```bash
cd ~/podium-projects/my-project
podium wp plugin list
podium wp user create john john@example.com --role=administrator
podium wp db export backup.sql
```

#### PHP Commands (Run from project directory)
```bash
cd ~/podium-projects/my-project
podium php -v                  # Check PHP version
podium php script.php          # Run PHP scripts
```

#### Container Access (Run from project directory)
```bash
cd ~/podium-projects/my-project
podium exec bash               # Access container as web user
podium exec-root bash          # Access container as root
```

**Why Containerized?** These commands run with your project's exact PHP version, extensions, and environment - ensuring consistency across team members and preventing "works on my machine" issues.

### System Management
```bash
# Stop all services only (keeps projects running)
podium stop-services

# Configure Podium environment
podium configure
```

### Get Help Anytime
```bash
# See all available commands
podium help
```

## ü§ñ JSON Automation & Scripting

Podium supports JSON output for automation and scripting:

### JSON Output Mode
```bash
# Get JSON output for any command
podium status --json-output
podium new my-app --json-output
podium clone https://github.com/user/repo --json-output
```

### Automation Examples
```bash
# Check if services are running in a script
if podium status --json-output | jq -r '.shared_services.mariadb.status' | grep -q "RUNNING"; then
    echo "Database is ready"
fi

# Automated project creation
podium new api-service --json-output | jq -r '.project_name'

# Batch project operations
for project in $(podium status --json-output | jq -r '.projects[].name'); do
    podium up $project --json-output
done

# CI/CD Integration
podium clone $REPO_URL $PROJECT_NAME --json-output --php-version 8
```

### GUI Integration
```bash
# The GUI uses JSON mode internally
podium gui                     # Launch visual interface
```

**GUI Features:**
- Visual project dashboard with real-time status
